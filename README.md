ATM Simulator
=================

This is an exercise in BDD and SOLID app development.  The project is a simulation of an ATM machine to run on an iPad.

An outline of the ATM requirement and suggested OOD is here: http://www.math-cs.gordon.edu/courses/cs211/ATMExample/

I'm not intending to strictly follow that, its more an exercise for me to see how to use good OOP techniques to build a simple but slightly less than trivial app.
